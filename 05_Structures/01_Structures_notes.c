A structure in C is a collection of variables of diffrent types under
a single name.

Why use structures?
We can create the data types in the employee structure separately
but when the number of properties in a structure increases, it
becomes difficult for us to create data variables without structures.
In a nut shell:

(a) structures keep the data organized

(b) structures make data management easy for the program.
